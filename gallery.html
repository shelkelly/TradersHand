                                    <p>Living in that empty inn where Mae and I died was a nightmare until I thought of something about
                                        us;
                                        we
                                        were
                                        about growth and didn’t stagnate because every day was a new day for us to share. We lived in
                                        the
                                        moment;
                                        the past was a memory and there was no promise of the future. Life was exciting and our love was
                                        ecstasy. I
                                        couldn’t let that die so I turned the inn where we died into a gallery… a light for Mae in the
                                        darkness,
                                        a
                                        place of memory and life.</p>

                                    <p>There was a particular handler called Vardoc who picked me out as his special pet

                                        for

                                    <p>That night, I dreamed of the caves again. I was standing over a dead man with his

                                        head
                                        in my hand. I picked it up and walked away with a deep sense of an injustice
                                        repaid.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>We were pulling back in teams of two after a raid on a village and I wondered
                                        aloud,
                                        “Why
                                        do
                                        they fight?” I wasn’t expecting an answer but my partner drew close, “Perhaps to
                                        protect
                                        their homes.” I didn’t understand, “Home?” She glanced at me with sadness in her
                                        eyes,
                                        “Home
                                        is your family.” I still didn’t understand, “Family?” “Those you love.” “Love?”
                                        We
                                        walked on
                                        in thoughtful silence for a moment and her eyes were distant when she answered
                                        quietly,
                                        “It’s something worth dying for.” We continued walking then she paused and put a
                                        hand on
                                        my

                                    <p>A man was sitting next to me staring into his knife and I was wondering what he
                                        was
                                        seeing in
                                        it when he brought it up as if in salute; etched into the polished metal was an
                                        image of
                                        a
                                        woman. It was then that I saw the deep cut in his side, a deadly wound. I looked
                                        around
                                        for
                                        a medic because it looked like there was still time to save him but help was
                                        nowhere
                                        in
                                        sight. He was hanging on to life with all he had and the sad hunger in his eyes
                                        as
                                        he
                                        stared
                                        into his blade helped me understand what a warrior-slave told me once about
                                        love;
                                        the
                                        dying
                                        man was living for his mate.</p>

                                        cover
                                        beside a
                                        dying man who spoke of home, a woman waiting for him and their dreams. There
                                        were
                                        tears
                                        in
                                        his eyes; I didn’t understand, “Why do you cry?” “Because she will when I don’t
                                        come
                                        home.”
                                        “Why?” “We love each other,” he whispered. When he died I took his head even
                                        though
                                        he
                                        wasn’t my kill and every night while we were on that planet I sat in my tent
                                        staring
                                        at
                                        his
                                        face, remembering the need in his eyes. I began to long for something in my life
                                        that I
                                        could care about, that would make me hunger for life more than I hungered to
                                        kill.

                                        the
                                        invaders with minimal loss of life. The night the last invading ship left, fires
                                        were
                                        lit
                                        all around the world and the celebration began. Wine was passed around and, as

                                        were singing and dancing, I started feeling strange, like I was being watched.
                                        Voices
                                        whispered in my head that I almost understood and, when I fell asleep, I drifted
                                        into a

                                        was
                                        as far away from that fraggin’ old man as I could get. I visited many worlds
                                        with
                                        one
                                        question in mind, “Could I care for this land enough to die for it?” Many places
                                        touched
                                        me
                                        but none changed my life. I met many women; some made me wonder if I could make
                                        a
                                        home
                                        with
                                        them but I found no one I would share my life with.</p>

                                    <p>The boat calls and I struggle to wait for the presence. Its call grows in
                                        intensity
                                        until

                                        becomes too strong to resist. I start for the boat then an overpowering hunger

                                        appears in the distance, too far to see clearly. As he approaches I’m drawn to

                                        I’m
                                        torn, him... the boat... the need to hold myself together. When he’s close

                                        look

                                    <p>“Elen Tolit is a slaver world, the greatest.” I got to the point, “Ever sold to
                                        Septra?”
                                        His
                                        suspicion returned, “Why?” I gave him a greedy look, “I hear they pay top for
                                        fighters.”
                                        The
                                        hardness left his eyes and he returned my avaricious smile, “We’ve grown rich
                                        off

                                        with red eyes and piled them up outside their ship.</p>

                                        Her

                                        was beyond the horizon when she murmured, “Following the moonpath.” We walked
                                        with

                                        thoughts, following the track of the moon along a wooded path, until we came to
                                        a
                                        beach
                                        where the warm moonglow laid out an amber blanket on the sand and played in the
                                        water.
                                        Mae
                                        dropped her clothes and waded through the radiance until it covered her
                                        shoulders; I
                                        went to
                                        her. Her honey-gold hair flowed around us and her limpid, sea-grey eyes shone in
                                        the
                                        soft
                                        gilded light. I gently wrapped my arms around her, turned a deaf ear to my fears
                                        and
                                        whispered, “Mae, I love you.” She pressed her soft, warm lips against mine and
                                        murmured,
                                        “You are my love, Paintr.” I felt a sense of belonging... oneness... completion.
                                        The
                                        stars

                                        repaid.

                                        surrounded by
                                        a group of armed people with blood-red eyes. They were outnumbered in the fight
                                        that
                                        started, the woman fell and her sword flew up into the air. When the man saw the
                                        sword
                                        he
                                        cut his way to her side and was killed, too.</p>

                                    <p>When I woke up I went to the studio and painted the disturbing dream and I was

                                        to

                                        asked.
                                        The other voice answered, “No, runt. Next.” I didn’t have to see who was
                                        talking; I
                                        knew
                                        Vardoc’s voice all too well. A moment later I heard a shout from your mate’s

                                        “Get

                                        scum!” Vardoc growled, “I choose, I get.” I barely heard her say, “Touch me and
                                        die.” It
                                        got
                                        quiet then I heard Vardoc howl in pain and after, the snap of his whip. I didn’t
                                        hear a
                                        sound from her while the whip kept cracking then she shouted, “We are

                                        Shortly
                                        after, Vardoc was talking with someone outside her door. The new voice asked why
                                        the
                                        warrior

                                        hands

                                        falls
                                        past me.</p>

                                    <p>I stare down into Mae’s sad, grey eyes until she’s swallowed up by the dark
                                        abyss.
                                    </p>

                                        live
                                        on.”
                                        “Or
                                        she could take the potion too,” I murmured. I didn’t need to think about it, I
                                        needed
                                        Mae,
                                        “Give it to me.”</p>

                                    <p>I stand on the shore of the Otherworld and when I feel the pull of the boat I’m
                                        torn
                                        away. I
                                        fight for focus as images fly past me, then I fall into madness.</p>

                                    <p>I awake to a dream of war. The enemy is a horror... brutal, reeking of death. One
                                        war
                                        follows
                                        another. I’m swept away in an eternity of bloodshed and my mind struggles for a
                                        hold
                                        on
                                        reality.</p>

                                    <p>Mae’s beautiful grey eyes fill my vision but there is no recognition in them.</p>

                                    <p>“Sáraigh, what if we lose each other?” she asked with an agonized whisper. With
                                        promise
                                        in my
                                        voice and my eyes I said, “I had a dream…”</p>

                                    <p>I don’t know how long I sail that still sea; the sun doesn’t move and the sea
                                        doesn’t
                                        change.... then I hear water crashing on rocks. It’s too dark to see them and I
                                        think I
                                        might run up on them. Suddenly, a distant light pierces the darkness. I wonder
                                        if
                                        it’s a
                                        beacon and make for it...</p>

                                    <p>...Mae rested her head on my shoulder and I wrapped my arms around her with a
                                        whispered,
                                        “No
                                        matter what happens, love, even death can’t keep us apart… I will always look
                                        for
                                        you
                                        and I
                                        will always find you. We are one you and I.”</p>
